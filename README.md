# BatchBoost
BatchBoost: Streamlined Bulk Processing for Banking Excellence

To showcase the batch processing functionality with Spring Batch, we will periodically read CSV files (e.g., from 10 am to 5 pm) 
containing information about employees registered for a hackathon. Subsequently, we will update the core banking system. 
At the end of the day (5 pm), we will retrieve all registered employees from the core banking system and initiate a fund transfer as a gift voucher 
for their participation using the core banking module for funds transfer.
